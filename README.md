# Project Name - Melanoma Detection Assignment
> To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
- This Melanoma Detection Assignment is solved to practice and apply Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN part of Deep Learning) as part of the machine learning program.
- We are trying to understand how quickly, efficiently and accurately the images can be detected and informed as particular skin cancer types 

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.0 - for coding purpose
- Git and Github - for pushing the code to the github platform
- Notepad - upload the github link in a document in the upgrad platform
- Libraries used - numpy, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn, tensorflow

## Acknowledgements
- The problem statement was given by IIIT-Upgrad collaboration project
